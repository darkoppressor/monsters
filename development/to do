Consumable items can be food, water, or medical supplies
Creatures have food and water needs
These needs tick down over time
These needs can be replenished by using the corresponding consumables
Medical supplies similarly replenish health
Stats are needed for immunity to hunger or thirst
Hunger and thirst needs progressively add more penalties to various stats
These penalties are themselves stats, and are percentages
A Creature will die if either need reaches 0

Need some kind of AI goal interruption eventually
Need some kind of AI goal prioritizing eventually

Add ranged weapons, slot, and the ability to do ranged attacks
Add ammo types, with consumable items for each
Ammo is consumed directly by its corresponding ranged weapon when the weapon fires

Add AI scores for relative strength of nearby friendlies vs hostiles when deciding whether to attack a creature
Add retreating as a goal
Retreating can happen if the above score is too nasty, or if the creature is weak
Retreating runs towards the nearest friendly creature
A Creature's weakness is based on its health level and needs
Figure out prioritizing of all current goals

Eventually with Tiles I need a concept of shelter
A Creature might prefer shelter to nearest friendly when deciding where to retreat to
Creatures need sleep, which contributes to weakness
Sleep need is refilled by sleeping, which requires shelter and no nearby enemies
With Tiles I also want a concept of home
Retreating to home could be the ultimate panic action
